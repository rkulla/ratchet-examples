Welcome to the Ratchet examples, by Ryan Kulla. Here you'll find the Go ETL framework examples
to go along with my [tutorial](rkulla.blogspot.com/2016/01/data-pipeline-and-etl-tasks-in-go-using.html).

* example1: Very basic Ratchet program. SQLReader and SQLWriter, no transformer.

* example2: Uses a transformer.

* example3: Simple branching pipeline.

* example4: More complex branching pipeline / batcher.

* example5: Dynamic SQLReader.

## Usage

   $ go get github.com/rkulla/ratchet-examples
   $ cd example1
   $ vim README  
   
Each example directory contains its own usage README and its **own** schema. 
So make sure you run each schema to populate the source databases first.

Ratchet and its dependencies are already vendored here, so you can get started
right away and with a known stable version.
